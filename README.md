## 🗂️ Some Previous Projects (Most Recent First)

### 🎥 **Real-Time Movement Detection on GECKO5EDUCATION Board**
Developed a real-time movement detection system using the Sobel edge detection algorithm, optimized for the GECKO5EDUCATION board (74.24 MHz). **Combined Verilog hardware acceleration with C-based software optimization to overcome performance limitations** of the CPU and achieve efficient image processing from an OV7670 camera. Created as part of the **CS-476 Embedded System Design** course at **EPFL**. [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/mbouaissi/virtualprototype.git)  

### 🔩 **MIPS R-10000-like Processor Simulator**
Developed a **cycle-accurate simulator of an out-of-order RISC-V processor architecture**, inspired by the MIPS R10000. The simulator models realistic hardware components such as register renaming, integer queues, active list, and exception handling, enabling detailed observation of pipeline state at every cycle. Created as part of the **CS-470 Advanced Computer Architecture** course at **EPFL**. [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/ThomasLenges/MIPS-R-10000-like-Processor-Simulator.git)

### 🧮 **VLIW Modulo Instruction Scheduler**
Designed and implemented a **static instruction scheduler for a VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) processor based on the RISC-V ISA and enhanced with Itanium-inspired loop pipelining**, predicate execution, and rotating registers. The project outputs two optimized schedules using loop and loop.pip constructs, demonstrating principles of software pipelining and instruction-level parallelism. Created as part of the **CS-470 Advanced Computer Architecture** course at **EPFL**. [🔗 Repository](https://github.com/mbouaissi/VLIW470.git)

### 📡 **OFDM Wireless Transmitter and Receiver**  
Designed and implemented a **MATLAB-based Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system** for wireless communication, ensuring efficient data transmission and reception. Created as part of the **EE-442 Wireless receivers: algorithms and architectures** course at **EPFL**.

### 🕹️ **Nintendo DS Game: Remple Tun**  
Developed **Remple Tun**, a **side-scrolling adventure game** for the Nintendo DS, programmed in **C**. The game features **dual-screen gameplay, animated backgrounds, and interactive mechanics**. Created as part of the **EE-310 Microprogrammed Embedded Systems** course at **EPFL**.  
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/NintendoDS_project)  

### 🎾 **VHDL Pong Game**  
Developed a **hardware-based version of the classic Pong game** using **VHDL**, featuring **VGA communication** on a **Pynq-Z2 FPGA board**. Created as part of the **EE-334 Digital systems design** course at **EPFL**.
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/ThomasLenges/FractalPong-A-PYNQ-Z2-Game)  

### 🎮 **Microcontroller Assembly Game**  
Designed and implemented a small game on a microcontroller using **assembly language**, demonstrating low-level hardware programming and optimization techniques. Created as part of the **EE-210 Microcontrollers** course at **EPFL**. 
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/renukasinghvirk/MCU_project)

### 💰 **Automated Coin Detection**  
Designed an automated classification **computer vision-based system** to identify coins from **euro and franc currency** while detecting and classifying other coins as a different type of currency. Created as part of the **EE-451 Image analysis and pattern recognition** course at **EPFL**. 
[🔗 Repository](https://github.com/ThomasLenges/Automated-Coin-Detection) 

### 🧬 **Predicting Experimental Conditions from Gene Expression**
A **machine learning project in Julia** for predicting the experimental condition (KAT5, CBP, or eGFP) of mouse brain cells based on gene expression levels, using **linear and neural network classifiers**. Created as part of the **BIO-322 Introduction to machine learning for bioengineers** course at **EPFL**.
